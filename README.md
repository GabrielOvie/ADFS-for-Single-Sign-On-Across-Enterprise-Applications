# ADFS-for-Single-Sign-On-Across-Enterprise-Applications
ADFS for SSO
## Objective:
Implementing Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) to provide Single Sign-On capabilities for 5000 users across 10 business-critical applications, reducing login-related helpdesk tickets by 70% and improving user productivity by 15% within 6 months of implementation.

## End Goals
- Achieve 99.9% ADFS uptime.
- Enable SSO for 10 key enterprise applications.
- Reduce password reset requests by 80%.
- Decrease login-related helpdesk tickets by 70%.
- Improve user login experience, reducing average login time from 45 seconds to under 10 seconds.
- Increase multi-factor authentication adoption to 100% for all privileged accounts.
- Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 4.5/5 for the new SSO experience.

## Tools Used
- Windows Server 2019
- Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
- Web Application Proxy
- SQL Server 2019 (for ADFS database)
- Azure AD Connect (for hybrid identity scenarios)
- PowerShell
- OpenSSL (for certificate management)
- SAML Tracer (Firefox add-on for SAML troubleshooting)
- Fiddler (for HTTP traffic analysis)
- Visual Studio Code (for script editing)

## Skills Gained
- Advanced understanding of federated identity concepts
- ADFS installation, configuration, and management
- SAML and OAuth protocol implementation
- Certificate management in a federated environment
- PowerShell scripting for ADFS automation
- High availability and load balancing for ADFS
- Security best practices for federated services
- Troubleshooting federated authentication issues

## Detailed Step-by-Step Approach:
Phase 1: Planning and Preparation (Need more work in 2 weeks)
1.1. Conduct a thorough inventory of all applications requiring SSO

List all applications with their authentication methods
Document user bases for each application
1.2. Design ADFS architecture
Plan for high availability (minimum 2 ADFS servers)
Design network topology, including DMZ for Web Application Proxy
1.3. Prepare Windows Server 2019 virtual machines for ADFS
Configure 4 VMs: 2 for ADFS, 2 for Web Application Proxy
Allocate resources: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 100GB storage each
1.4. Set up SQL Server 2019 for ADFS database
Install SQL Server 2019 on a separate VM
Configure SQL AlwaysOn for high availability
1.5. Obtain and prepare SSL certificates
Request wildcard certificate for *.company.com
Prepare service communication certificate for ADFS

Phase 2: ADFS Installation and Configuration (1 week)
2.1. Install ADFS role on primary server

Use PowerShell for unattended installation:
powershellCopyInstall-WindowsFeature ADFS-Federation -IncludeManagementTools


2.2. Configure ADFS using PowerShell

Run initial configuration:
powershellCopyImport-Module ADFS
Install-AdfsFarm -CertificateThumbprint <thumb> -FederationServiceName "sts.company.com" -ServiceAccountCredential (Get-Credential)


2.3. Set up secondary ADFS server

Install ADFS role
Join to existing farm using PowerShell:
powershellCopyAdd-AdfsFarmNode -CertificateThumbprint <thumb> -PrimaryComputerName "adfs01.company.com"


2.4. Configure ADFS database on SQL Server

Move ADFS configuration database to SQL Server for HA

Phase 3: Web Application Proxy Setup (3 days)
3.1. Install Web Application Proxy role on DMZ servers
3.2. Configure Web Application Proxy

Connect to ADFS farm
Set up certificate for external access

Phase 4: Load Balancing Configuration (2 days)
4.1. Set up internal load balancer for ADFS servers
4.2. Configure external load balancer for Web Application Proxies
4.3. Test and verify load balancing functionality
Phase 5: Integrating Applications (3 weeks)
5.1. Develop a standard process for adding relying party trusts
5.2. For each application:

Add relying party trust in ADFS
Configure claim rules
Update application to trust ADFS
Test SSO functionality
5.3. Document specific steps for each application integration

Phase 6: Multi-Factor Authentication Setup (1 week)
6.1. Install and configure MFA server
6.2. Integrate MFA with ADFS
6.3. Set up MFA policies for different user groups
Phase 7: Testing and Optimization (1 week)
7.1. Conduct comprehensive testing

Functionality testing across all applications
Load testing to ensure performance under stress
Failover testing for high availability
7.2. Optimize ADFS performance
Fine-tune SQL Server performance
Adjust ADFS server settings for optimal performance

Phase 8: Security Hardening (3 days)
8.1. Implement ADFS security best practices

Enable Extended Protection for Authentication
Configure proper endpoint authentication
8.2. Set up monitoring and alerting for ADFS
8.3. Implement regular security auditing process

Phase 9: User Training and Roll-out (1 week)
9.1. Develop user training materials
9.2. Conduct training sessions for different user groups
9.3. Plan and execute phased roll-out to user base
9.4. Set up dedicated support team for initial weeks post-launch
Phase 10: Documentation and Handover (1 week)
10.1. Finalize all technical documentation
10.2. Create troubleshooting guides for support team
10.3. Develop standard operating procedures for ADFS management
10.4. Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with IT team
Phase 11: Post-Implementation Review (1 week)
11.1. Gather and analyze metrics (login times, helpdesk tickets, etc.)
11.2. Conduct user satisfaction survey
11.3. Identify areas for improvement
11.4. Plan for future enhancements (e.g., integrating more applications)
